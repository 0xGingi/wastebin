[![Rust](https://github.com/matze/wastebin/actions/workflows/rust.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/matze/wastebin/actions/workflows/rust.yml)

A minimal pastebin shamelessly copied from
[bin](https://github.com/WantGuns/bin). Things different from bin:

* sqlite3 and axum backend
* light/dark mode
* paste expiration
* line numbers

## Build and run

Install a Rust 2021 toolchain with [rustup](https://rustup.rs) and run the
server binary with

    $ cargo run --release

Alternative use the provided `Dockerfile`.


## Configuration

The following environment variables can be set to configure the server:

* `WASTEBIN_DATABASE_PATH` path to the sqlite3 database file. If not set, an
  in-memory database is used.
* `WASTEBIN_ADDRESS_PORT` string that determines which address and port to bind
  a. If not set, it binds by default to `0.0.0.0:8088`.

Additionally you can use the `RUST_LOG` environment variable to influence
logging. Besides the typical `trace`, `debug`, `info` etc. keys, you can also
set the `tower_http` key to some log level to get additional information request
and response logs.
